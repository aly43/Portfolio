      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <h1>Field or Career</h1>
    
  <h2>As of 10/31/21 I am in my final semester at the University of Pittsburgh. I am majoring in CS, however my true goal is to make enough money
     and then become a commercial pilot. It's not that I dislike SWE, I just feel like I am more passionate about being an air bus-driver.
     I used to play Ultimate Frisbee, and I used to be pretty good. I made the A team here at Pitt which is ranked top 10 nationally, however because
     of the pandemic, I lost all passion I had for the game so I quit. Currently, I am working part time at a financial institute as a software engineer.

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->
